# AI-Based-Personality-Prediction-Using-Handwriting-Analysis
  This project aims to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to predict an individual's personality traits based on their handwriting characteristics. Handwriting is a behavioral biometric that reflects cognitive and psychological patterns. By analyzing features such as slant, pressure, size, and spacing, the system uses regression models to estimate personality dimensions based on the Big Five traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing handwriting samples and associated personality scores, enabling automated and efficient personality assessment without the need for subjective psychological tests.
